#Python Chatbot
A custom Python chatbot that interacts through the terminal! It can greet users, tell jokes, perform math operations, share fun facts, provide the current time, reverse words, and more. The chatbot runs in a loop until "bye" is typed, summarizing the conversation at the end. Perfect for beginners exploring Python!
